This is a simple html website with a home, about, contact, and page to consider adopting a pet 

https://github.com/travisjr12/Pet-Rescue-Site

i created a adopting page using a form with input types and place holders for the application to adopt
i also used simple header and paragraphs for the about me page

this enables styling only using html with the styles.css page
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
i enjoyed this framework because it lets you traverse the different pages when clicked
i learned i had to put this on each and every html page so it links correctly not just one was the mistake
<div id="highlight">
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="about.html">About</a>
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    <a href="Rescues.html">Rescues</a>
  </div>
  
  i enjoyed this which allows insert images from the internet 
  finding the image was easy getting the correct url was hard copy and pasting because certain links doesnt upload the picture
  <img src="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2021/jul/images/rescue-hero.jpg" alt="row of adoptable pets">

  since this was a html only project with css styles only certain classes were created with 
  class or id refernces in the css page which # for id and .myclass for classes
